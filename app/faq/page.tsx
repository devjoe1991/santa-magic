    question: "What types of photos work best?",

    question: "Is my photo data secure?",
    answer: "Yes, your privacy is important to us. Your photos are processed securely and are not stored permanently on our servers. We only use your images to create your Santa video and then securely delete them from our systems."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request specific Santa poses or actions?",
    answer: "Our AI automatically selects the most appropriate Santa pose and actions based on your photo's composition and lighting. This ensures the most natural and realistic result. We don't currently offer custom pose requests, but our AI is designed to create the perfect Christmas moment for your specific scene."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have technical issues?",
